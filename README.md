## Overview

This plugin provides audit logging for various Jenkins events.
These include build lifecycles, node lifecycles, login/logout, item lifecycles, and some other events.
These audit events use [Apache Log4j Audit][log4j-audit-site] to define standardized event interfaces and logging through Apache Log4j2 plugins.
